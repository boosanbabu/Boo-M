/**
 * Question : Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the
 * lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
 * 
 * If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest
 * possible order (i.e, sorted in ascending order).
 * 
 * The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.
 * 
 * Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its
 * corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.
 * 
 * 1,2,3 → 1,3,2 | 3,2,1 → 1,2,3 | 1,1,5 → 1,5,1
 *
 * @see <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/">Leetcode</a>
